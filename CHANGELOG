== 0.8.5 2011-03-05

* Added encoding option seek_time (thanks to Misty De Meo)

== 0.8.3 2011-09-01

* Parameters now come in the order of codecs, presets, others so that we can override the presets
* Added encoding option keyframe_interval to set number of frames between i-frames (aka GOP size)
* Streamio (sponsor of this project) have launched new awesome pricing @Â http://streamio.com

* Don't use encoding options with nil values
* Added encoding options video_max_bitrate, video_min_bitrate and buffer_size for constant bitrate encoding

* Cropping options now handled by EncodingOptions (croptop, cropbottom, cropleft and cropright)
